# Tableau--Insights-on-Travel-Survey


I want to tell a story about travel and exploration as I’m a person who is always excited about travel and hoping to travel the world soon. I was curious to know how and where people travel/would love to. Understanding the user’s needs is the first step in the analysis. In order to understand which information would be useful for travel lovers like me, I collected data using a survey from my friends/acquaintances. They would be my primary prospective users and also, of course, anyone who is interested in traveling. These are some of the questions I asked them for the survey.

    1.The places you have traveled before/ would be interested to travel to?
    2.Would you like to travel solo/in groups?
    3.Adventures/Activities you have explored/would like to explore as a tourist?
    4.What motivates you to travel?
    5.What information would be useful to you for planning future trips?
This survey helped me understand what they expect and frame specific exploratory questions.
Based on the answers I get for the most wanted places and adventures, I used the web to collect data from travel industries and other sources to create visualizations. Some of the questions might include understanding the most traveled destinations in the world, Percentage of solo travelers, people who travel in groups/ with family, etc and the top 5 to-do things pertaining to the cities, different foods to try out, categorization of hotels to stay based on budget and much more.
